> a firebase app for braindr: Tinder for brains

## Firebase setup

1. Create a firebase account
2. Click on "Web Setup" and copy paste your config into `src/firebaseConfig.js`
3. Go to the Authentication and click "Sign-In method" and enable Email/Password
4. Go to the Database tab and click "Rules" and copy paste the following:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "users": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null",
    },
    "settings": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": false,
    }
  }
}
```

5. run the app: `npm run dev` and open `localhost:8080`. Create a new account
6. Go to the Database tab in Firebase. Create a key value pair like this:

```
settings: {
  admins: {
    your_username: true,
  }
}
```
7. Go to the uploads tab and upload a few images. They need to be unique filenames
8. Also host your images somewhere else (like S3), it will be cheaper to pull images from there instead of firebase
9. Edit the `imageBaseUrl` in `src/components/Play.vue` to point to your images. The url will have the image name appended to the end with the `.jpg` extension
10. Start playing

These instructions will probably change soon. The app is still being actively developed!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
